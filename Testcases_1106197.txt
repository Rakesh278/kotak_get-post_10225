Security Testing
________________

Test Case 1:
____________

1. Do a CORE Login
2. Invoke HBKTM menu, do ADD operation
3. Intercept the request using proxy tool on doing a Submit in criteria screen.
4. Change POST method to GET in proxy tool and forward the request.

Configuration/Parameters/Setup:
__________________________
Add below content after "SECURE_CHECK_REQD" section
FileName: web.xml
Path : finbranch.war/WEB-INF. If WAS server, under this path also <WASProfile>/config/cells/<CellName>/applications/finbranch_war.ear/deployments/finbranch_war/finbranch.war/WEB-INF

	<init-param>
		<param-name>HTTPMETHOD_CHECK_REQD</param-name>
		<param-value>Y</param-value>
	</init-param>	

Observed behavior before patch:
________________________________
Application accepts the request and proceeds further.

Expected behavior after patch:
________________________________
1. Application should not accept request and ends in error message on UI.
2. SecureFilter.log under FE/common/log/finbranch should have the failure entry.

Test Case 2:
____________

1. Do a CORE Login
2. Invoke HBKTM menu, do ADD operation
3. Intercept the request using proxy tool on doing a Submit in criteria screen.
4. Change POST method to GET in proxy tool and forward the request. This lands in error message on UI.
5. Being on error screen, invoke another menu from menushortcut.
